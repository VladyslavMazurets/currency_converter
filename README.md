Currency Converter 

Live site: https://currency-converter-teal-six.vercel.app/

In this project, I created a currency converter using React, TypeScript, API (available in free access: https://exchangerate.host/ ) well-known Tailwind CSS framework. This app is fully responsive. This project includes a main converter that has two mutually dependent inputs and also two selectors for selecting the currency for conversion. Under the main converter there are two tables showing conversions to the most popular amounts in two directions (from-to and to-from). There is also a button that, when pressed, changes the direction of conversion to the opposite.

The main elements that were used in the creation of the project: 
1) ReactJS and TypeScript
2) axios;
3) Tailwind CSS
4)  React Select: 
5) React Icons; 
6) API

Setup: run npm i ,
       npm start -
       to start the development server
